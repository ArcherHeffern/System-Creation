1. Creating repositories and commits
    1. Create a git history that looks like the following. You will have to create a git repository and make 3 commits. The contents of each commit can be whatever you like.

    2. Checkout your previous commits (move your head around)

2. Branching practice
You may use the repo from exercise 1. Create 2 branches, main and hi_mom. Main should say "hi dad", while hi_mom should say "hi mom". Draw this out first, and then do this in vscode.

Then merge and fix the merge conflict
