# On Complexity
There is a lot of literature on simplicity and complexity

"*An idiot admires complexity, a genius admires simplicity*... "
- Terry Davis, Creator of Temple OS

"The definition of genius is taking the complex and making it simple."
- Albert Einstein

Important: 
Galls Law: "*A complex system that works is invariably found to have evolved from a simple system that worked.* A complex system designed from scratch never works and cannot be patched up to make it work. You have to start over with a working simple system."
- John Gall, Author of General systemantics: an essay on how systems work, and especially how they fail... (1975)

# Iterative Development
Don't do too much. This is applied on all fronts:
* Business 
* Software

This is a little different for personal projects and as a student: 
* Do too much to LEARN - just understand that its unoptimal in an actual business

Instead create something really basic that works, then continuously in little steps make it better
We call this iterative development. Which is the founding ideology of Lean / Agile methodologies for project management

Plan => Code => Test => repeat

1. Come up with an idea
2. Do some research (Read a paper or watch a video)
3. First iteration: Plan MVP (minimum viable product) - Later iterations: Plan next feature 
4. Code it up
5. Ensure it works (test it)
6. Go to step 3

## Notes
* Always create an MVP
* Have fun and don't overthink
* In some cases the entire project will be planned entirely in advance (waterfall development). Don't do this for personal projects.
* This process will be more complicated in an industry setting, but the core is still the same
