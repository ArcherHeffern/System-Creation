1. Creating repositories and commits
    1. Create a git history that looks like the following. You will have to create a git repository and make 3 commits. The contents of each commit can be whatever you like.
    ![git_history](static/main.png)
    2. Checkout your previous commits (move your head around)

2. Branching practice
You may use the repo from exercise 1. Create 2 branches, main and hi_mom. Main should say "hi dad", while hi_mom should say "hi mom". Draw this out first, and then do this in vscode.

3. Merging practice
Using the git repo from exercise 2, merge hi_mom into main.

4. Fix a merge conflict
TODO
run 
``` bash
git clone <URL>
```
Then merge and fix the merge conflict

5. Create a git repo that looks like
