First run the server
```bash
python mail_server.py
```
Then run the client
```bash
python mail_client.py
```

The mail client doesn't do anything crazy, you can just send messages to the server (WOW!)

The mail server recieves messages from a client, and passes the messages to MailProtocol. This is where you come in!
