## Holy Grail Information
You do not exist to simply read the slides (If that were the case, we would just give them this github!). Instead you should teach. This means paying attention to your students. Pick an alert student in the room, and talk directly to them. Use your god given social skills to gauge if they understand, and make adjustments accordingly.  

*This will also help if you have anxiety since now its not a crowd, its just one person*

## Other Important notes
* Don't screen share, this content is much too dense and distracting. Instead, talk and use a whiteboard to draw things out
* Don't use slides, they are a selling tool, not an educating tool
* Screen share if there is something a diagram or some visual of interest - then afterwards stop the share
* Repeat things
