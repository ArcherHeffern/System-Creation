# TamidTechEducation

Notes for teaching: 
* Don't screen share, this content is much too dense and distracting. 
* Instead, talk and use a whiteboard to emphasize, and provide a sort of visual history of the though process
* I would highly recommend against using slides, they are a selling tool, not an educating tool
* Repeat things
* Screen share if there is something a diagram or some visual of interest - then afterwards stop the share
