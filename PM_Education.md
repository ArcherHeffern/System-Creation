# PM Education
## Before Project
* Get access to Tamid Consulting Dashboard
* Get a project - See the consulting dashboard resources for a guide
    * To see more than 3 projects - Use my [scraper](https://github.com/archerheffern/scrapetamid) 
* Learn the fundementals of iterative / lean development
* Scrum board: Use trello - Should have sections as follows:
    * Resources: Links to resources everyone should have access to (eg. Github repo, google drive, etc, relevent papers, etc)
    * Backlog: List of stories/tasks not yet started
    * In progress: List of stories/tasks members have verbally agreed to complete by X time
    * Done: Completed stories
    * Archive: Things we were going to do, but didn't 
    * Notes: If its a really large project, you may want to split backlog into P1, P2, and P3. P1 is for stuff we need done now, P2 is for stuff we should get done in some time, and p3 is stuff we would like, but don't need
* Documentation: Create a Google Drive
* Communication: Use Slack
* Understand the project and create a basic education. Should last 1-3 weeks
* Interview members
* Send out NDA's

* Set up repo:
    * Create a github Repo
    * Protect the main branch. Require pull request 
    * Containerize: I suggest using the VScode dev containers extension to automate this
    * Ensure everyone has git, a package manager (apt (linux/windows) brew (macos)), and wsl if on windows

## First Meeting
See 01_intro.md for reference

* Meet after general meeting
* Establish credibility - who are you, why should people care
* Set expectations 
* Explain the track
* Set up time and place to meet (Send a when2meet) - Afterwards reserve a room

## General Operations
* Get your MVP as fast as possible - Then add additional features for learning sake. This will prevent a lot of stress

* Delegate work: Ensure members KNOW what is happening and what they are responsible for
* Meet with clients 1x per week
* Check in with members
