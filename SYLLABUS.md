# Intro
1. Intro, How to learn

TODO
[ ] Create intro 
[ ] Finish syllabus
[ ] Create list of projects students can attempt
[ ] Provide resources for getting started in different fields

# OS
1. CLI
2. C
3. System calls

TODO
[ ] C language education (currently all examples in python)

# Network 
1. The Internet pt1. Protocols, TCP/IP Model, and Sockets
    * HW: Case study on TCP
2. The Internet pt2. Hands on mail protocol with sockets
    * Finish the protocol
3. Architectures (Client/Server, P2P), Overview of Frontend/Backend, HTTP / Websocket
    * Designing architectures and something with web server
4. More HTTP: JSON, Query string parameters, path parameters, hands on mail server
    * Finish basic HTTP Backend Server
5. Databases pt1. Essentials
    * 
6. Databases pt2. Hands on mail server with state
    * 


# Network 
TODO: 
[ ] DNS
[ ] Data fetching and page fetching
[x] JSON and other hypermedia
[ ] Databases
[x] Monolith? 
[x] System design Overview: Performance, Reliability, Scalability, Security
[x] External API's (eg. Stripe)  - go over more advanced client server during this time
[ ] Hackathon Project
[ ] Finish protocol completed answer
[ ] TCP reading as first homework with whitepaper as supplement? 
[ ] Work through layers during first lesson?
[ ] Have second lesson be recap + create protocol
[ ] Split lesson 2 into 2 and 3
[ ] System design: Two tier and three-tier database architecture. Microservice, client server, if you can think of it, you can do it. Designing systems takes creativity

## Supplementary Content
### How to Learn
Don’t read everything! You don’t need to know everything! Learn how to skim and evaluate what's important
Watch [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nqYmmZKY4sA) video for how to read textbooks before you waste time 

### Networking
* [RFC](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc79) (Request for comment): The official internet standards. Every implementation of a protocol or layer or whatever internet related MUST follow these standards.
* [InternetWhitepaper](https://web.stanford.edu/class/msande91si/www-spr04/readings/week1/InternetWhitepaper.htm)
* [TCP/IP Illustrated](https://www.isi.edu/~hussain/TEACH/Spring2014/notes/Steven00a.pdf)
