# README
This is a focus on internetless applications, with a focus on Linux based. 

We start with creating a command line application with the Only IO used being stdin, stdout, and stderr. We then add other IO to improve the application. eg. File IO for peristant state, Unix Domain Sockets for multiple user IO on a single machine, etc

You may be thinking, archer, what is this?? This is so stupid and insane! I hear you and this is a significant work in progress. The following are my current major thoughts regarding the matter

While the tooling for many platforms is different, the logic is always the same and honestly IMO not very interesting. Different platforms may provide different APIs or folder structures or other tooling but at the  end of the day, itâ€™s some UI library, some native APIs, and some controlling logic. As a little foray into this we will experiment with desktop (or any Linux non Stdout IO methods), and then delve into the wonderful world of distributed applications.

(Can I conceptually call this all web dev?)

My goal is to make frontend seem simple, because conceptually it is. We will a little bit of experience with UI's using linux based IO. Draw connections to how other hardwares work (IOS, Android, perhaps Windows?), and how they are pretty much the same and very easy to learn. 

Then we will transition to distributed Applications which introduces computer networking, basic system design, databases, API's, and web dev as an emergent property. 


# Applications (Backendless)
## Why
Software development is a large place, there is so much to do. However, applications are very relevent in todays day and age.  
Q: Why applications, why aren't we doing web development or mobile app?  
A: They are all so similar, to specialize now would be a crime to you all  

Adding computer networking 

## Examples
There are many types of business applications
1. Terminal Based
2. Websites
3. Mobile
4. Desktop

I will not cover mobile, as due to being on custom hardware, 

While seemingly very different...

Differences: 
* Installation
* Languages
* APIs

They are very similar and arise from the same roots 
2 Components
* IO
* Functionality

<!-- TODO: Expand on this -->
Our approach: 
start with just a basic terminal program with a basic UI - non stateful, we run the program once and we do commands from inside. Then we make it run one command at a time and stores data in files. We can now start thinking about making our UI Better... we can also start thinking about making storing more complex data easier and more reliable with a database

__IO Options__
* GUI (Java Swing, OpenGL, Tkinter, etc)
* Write to files (system calls: open, read, write, lseek, close)
* Network (sockets) -> Send data to any other sockets on your network (system calls: socket, bind, accept, listen, connect)
* Speaker / other peripheral IO Devices
* Other [IPC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inter-process_communication) methods

Some of these are good for UI, some, not so much

Real world examples: 
* GUI: Desktop applications
* Files: Filetype conversion tools
* Network: Yeller Program - recieves messages from user through network (eg. address 127.0.0.1 port 8080) and sends back message uppercased
* Speaker: Zoom

These IO Options aren't just for to interface with the user. We can use them to perform "other" roles.  
*Note: Multiple IO devices are frequently used in a single program*

Q: Brainstorm how we can use Files and the network for actions other than directly interfacing with the user
A: 
* Files are good for storing data between executions of a program
* The network is good for communicating with other programs (globally), making your program accessable (globally), and generally sending information to a machine anywhere on earth assuming internet connection
    * Note: A computer can send network requests to itself


# Practice
1. Mail program. Only accessable from the machine its on and when the program ends all information is lost. Interaction happens at the command line
2. ... Now data should persist
3. ... Now create a nice user interface for it. <!-- TODO: The ordering here seems wrong - also whats up with mobile app ;-; eugh explaining server and application is going to be a pain here TODO: figure this out-->

Q: What do we have now: A program that can be used by several people, but only on the same machine, how can we make this globally accessable?
# Distributed Applications
This will take some refactoring depending on what approach you would like to take...and some discression on seperation of concerns
A: Computer Network. There is a range of approach:
* Peer to Peer: All applications talk to eachother
* Centralized server: All applications talk to a main computer that 

4. Now we may want to make our program have globally accessable shared state, maybe we would like it so , so how do we do this? 
4. ... This is where the methods differ: Make it globally accessable. If website or app create backend 

Note to self: Network can be easily reasoned about by thinking of it as; instead of sending commands through the command line, we are now sending the exact same commands through the network. show image of this later

# Computer Networking

# Client Applications
You have to change application depending on what platform its running on

This is all stuff you can teach yourself
* Run through the basic getting started so its not unfamiliar

# Distributed Systems
