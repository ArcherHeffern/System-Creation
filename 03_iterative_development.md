# Iterative Development
Galls Law: "*A complex system that works is invariably found to have evolved from a simple system that worked.* A complex system designed from scratch never works and cannot be patched up to make it work. You have to start over with a working simple system."
- John Gall, Author of General systemantics: an essay on how systems work, and especially how they fail... (1975)

Don't do too much. This is applied to both Software and Business. Instead create something simple that works, then continuously improve it in little steps.

This is the foundation of *iterative development*

Plan => Code => Test => Repeat

1. Come up with an idea and write down goals
    * I suggest writing down what basic actions you would like the user to be able to do
2. Do some research on the theory (Read paper or watch a video)
3. First iteration: Plan MVP - Later iterations: Plan next feature 
4. Code it up
5. Ensure it works (test it)
6. Go to step 3

## Notes
* Always create an MVP
* Have fun and don't overthink - Coding for yourself should be fun (prevents burnout) and this process is actually pretty simple
* In some industry cases the entire project will be planned entirely in advance (waterfall development). Don't do this for personal projects.
* This process will be more complicated in an industry setting, but the core is still the same
* As a student, its ok to do too much for learning sake - just understand that its unoptimal in an actual business setting
* We will add onto this model later when we start thinking about industry code

Notice his development process.  
He did his research beforehand and knows what he generally wants. He created a very basic model makes sure its was correct with some print statements. Then he iterates. He thinks of an improvement, maybe does some googling, and then implements the change, and repeats this process.
