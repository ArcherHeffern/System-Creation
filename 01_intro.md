# About this Course
* Split into 2 sections: Personal Software Development and Business Software Development
* Start with very foundational concepts, much lower level that you will typically find, we then build up through abstractions
* Lots of creative freedom: The world of software is a large place and I would like everyone to find out what they enjoy
    * We will later focus on Backend Development due to it being a common Tamid Project 
* There will be homework and projects
* Research and Code Heavy
