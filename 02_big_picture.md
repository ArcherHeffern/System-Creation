# My Advice
* Be hungry: Learn as much as possible, go for breadth and depth, form opinions on software/methodologies, be active on campus, get leadership roles
* Sell yourself: Make sure people know (or think) you are smart, kind, and hardworking
* People are important: Have an amazing support group, have non CS friends, and meet interesting people
* Understand the business side: Don't just be someone who can code

It's going to be hard.

# Possible projects 
When starting out, you will probably do projects just for experience, even if they aren't original, this is completely fine. Once you get better, try to do projects that fix an issue. Ask professors or friends.
