# On College Computer Science
* Be hungry, learn as much as possible, form opinions on software/methodologies, be active on campus
* Sell yourself, make sure people know (or think) you are smart, kind, and hardworking
* Have good friends, have non CS friends, meet interesting people
* Understand the business side, don't just be someone who can code
* Always go for leadership roles

It's going to be incredibly hard.
You will want to cry.
I can provide guidance, but the other 99% is on you.
Eventually if you do well, you can snowball
