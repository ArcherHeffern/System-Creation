# My Advice
Be hungry: Learn as much as possible, form opinions on software/methodologies, be active on campus. Go for breadth and later you can go for depth
Sell yourself: Make sure people know (or think) you are smart, kind, and hardworking
People are important: Have an amazing support group, have non CS friends, and meet interesting people
Understand the business side: Don't just be someone who can code
Get leadership roles: You will learn so much more

It's going to be incredibly hard.
It's a marathon.
Keep going.
