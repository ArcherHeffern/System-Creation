The 4 core skills to be a amazing programmer:
* Memory
* Brainpower
* Drive
* Learning

Lets learn about learning

In the beginning, resources such as youtube, ChatGPT, and random articles will be helpful. 
Once you reach advanced material, these resources will not help you.


The best way to learn is by reading code, documentation, books and papers
*Code is the best documentation, it states exactly what is going on*

Always find the documentation of the medium you are using:

If you want to learn shell, the command *man* (manual) is your best friend. Since its a command, it also has documentation
```bash
man man
```
You could turn off your internet, and learn EVERYTHING about your computer, just from this one command. 

If you want to learn about the internet, RFC (request for comment) are specifications for how all the internet works. 



Papers are also amazing, use wikipedia, google, google scholar, books, or library databases
