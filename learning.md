# Core Genetic Skills
There are ~4 core skills to be a amazing programmer:

* Memory
* Brainpower
* Drive
* Learning

_You don't need all of these to be a good programmer_

# Learning
Learning is the easiest one to learn

In the beginning, resources such as youtube, ChatGPT, and random articles will be helpful. 
Once you reach advanced material, they will become less useful or literally useless


The best way to learn is by reading...
* code
* documentation
* books / papers

...in conjunction with doing!

## Code
You can often find source code for projects or libraries online. Just google for it or search on github
[Malloc source](https://codebrowser.dev/glibc/glibc/malloc/malloc.c.html)
[Linux OS source](https://github.com/torvalds/linux)

If the codebase is complex, use a debugger

## Documentation
Always find the documentation of the medium you are using  

bash / zsh: The command *man* (manual) gives the documentation. Since its a command, it also has documentation
```bash
man man
```

If you want to learn about the internet, RFC (request for comment) are specifications for how all the internet works. 
[IP Protocol](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc791)

## Books / Papers
Books and Papers are amazing, use google scholar, library databases, or ask professors what they recommend (Professor Liuba is a gem!)
* The art of computer programming, Donald Knuth
* TCP / IP Illustrated, Richard Stevens

# General Tips
* Don't get caught up in tutorial hell
* You don't need to know everything, so don't learn everything
* Learn at least 1 programming language truly in depth
* The goal is to code, so code as much as possible
