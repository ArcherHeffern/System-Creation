We are going to be using flask, a python web server framework.  

It is very minimalistic, and as such you have a lot of freedom to break the rules.  

Run 'install.sh' if yo don't know how to use pip or make a virtual environment, otherwise, just pip install flask

Have fun!


One of the most valuable skills you can have as a SWE is the ability to read documentation
Flask Documentation: https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/3.0.x/
