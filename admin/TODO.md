# Ideas
* [Business presentations](https://github.com/TAMID-Tech-Consulting/education-resources/blob/master/slides/technical-presentations-in-business/Technical%20Presentations%20in%20Business.pdf)
* API, SDK, Libraries, Frameworks
* General Industry Tips
    * Presenting
    * If you need to reach out - let the person know what you have tried
    * Let people know directly when you have done a PR
    * CEO Rule: Don't come just with a problem, but also a solution so well though out all they have to say is yes. If you only tell them problems (no solution), they won't like you very much.
    * Make as many friends as possible
    * Assume you have to do it yourself
    * Sometimes just do things and ask for forgiveness later
    * Learn how to navigate politics
    * Stand up for yourself
* UI / UX
* Basic web dev
* Provide references to the GNU Project for coding standards? 
* Concurrency??? Processes, threads, shared memory and message passing
* Review standard library? 
* OS and SYS modules

Second half being PM Training / General Business Development  


Class attendance:
Have to put name on GitHub and resolve conflicts HAHAHA

Progression: 
Terminal Applications => Applications using Other IO / Interfaces => Distributed Applications

* Mention how managing risk and complexity play a large role in business application development
    * It tends to be that a lot of the code and work we do isn't actually the actual product, but things to manage the development of the project (Most things in devops) and managing (Testing) risk

* Learn how to use a debugger
    * You are smart people with fallable memories, let the computer do the heavy lifting
    * Especially helpful when your working in large or complex codebases
* Have fun!
    * I seriously mean this, programming is a lifelong journey and if its not fun, life is gonna suck
# Things to get started with development
* know how to make an application
* Debugging abilities
* Native API's and libraries and system calls
* Terminal
* How to learn / Figure things out
* Iterative development
* Testing
* Git
* Code reuse: Libraries, frameworks, packages, external API's
* Data modeling
* Networking

Business development:
1. Customer centric - you exist to solve a problem
2. Know how to empirically measure success (know your KPI’s and OBSESS over them)

Mention how important business is - I know some of you may look down on business majors - they are dumb, and that might be true, but business itself is the lifeblood of what you will be doing

Some notes on writing good code:
- beautiful code - readable
- I know you learned X in OOP, however, be wary of overabstracting, and of trying to design everything everything beforehand. This is not good for 2 reasons: 1. … 2. It’s not fun


# Misc
plan => code => test => deploy
build => measure => learn
UI
Program logic
State / Data

Other important aspects: 
* DevOps (This is a simplified version)
    * Deployment / Building
    * Monitoring
    * Testing 

Things to create: 
* Product (library, framework, drivers, language...)
* Service (website, )
Some are both: ex. Multiplayer video game, you must install the video game (product) and use their servers (service)
