Computer Science and Coding is not Solved

Attention to “Folder Hierarchies” or “Clean Coding” or all the other crazy design patterns is a red herring. 

Nobody has “solved coding” - there are some principles that can help - but those come way later. Right now, just code and have fun.

If you think you are being clever with a wild pattern or abstraction, you’re doing too much. Write the stupid obvious code, because you are stupid.


A lot of the super crazy technologies today you yourself can implement. 

1. Figure out the MVP
2. Know the algorithms
3. Know the base API’s available

Get comfortable making stupid small little things. And doing little steps. People often try to do too much and then burn out or think they are too stupid



Ignoring the hype and small minded way of looking at things:
Everyone wants to sell you something - I don’t, I’m just having fun.

Interface Model


People tend to think software engineering is like math. We are creating beautiful solutions, that there is elegance. 

There is elegance in algorithms, and perhaps data.

There is very rarely elegance in systems, especially those that evolve over time.

Instead it is all about managing what you have, and making sure when shit is about to hit the fan, you can delay it. 

There is rarely a correct way to create a system. Instead, just write code, and learn how to evolve  a system later. 


TODO: How to think about software development. 
=> What is software development about: Algorithms, Data, Interfaces, and Tools
=> Start off with a very Interface oriented approach. State how they can hodgepodge shit together and make it work 
=> In depth API’s, Map of API’s, and using all manners of API’s
=> Basic tools, learning / researching, lean methodologies, debugging, networking
=> Start Web development focus
=> Deployment
=> Then how to create business code 
=> How to scale up their program



What application will we be running on
How will we install our application
What will our applications interfaces be
