I am going to teach you all a model of thinking about software that can be applied to any domain. 

I find CS students at your level are very focused on technologies and languages, things that do not translate very well. 

Things like react, next, flask, javascript, jest, mongodb. 

This will be more conceptual and it may be difficult to start thinking in this way. 


1. What is code about 

Solving Problems with: 
Algorithms
Data

These are the defecto standard of what programming is. However, this is very academic and does not translate very well into the real world. There are things missing.

Interfaces
Architecture, design, and _ patterns
tools (Tools you don’t use directly within your code)
 
What will I focus on 
Algorithms: No, these are highly domain specific and there are no algorithms that translate well. Instead, learn your domain, and read papers!

Data: No. You should already know most of the important ones (Arrays, Lists, HashMaps, Sets). And same as above, there are also specialized data structures in domains. 

Interfaces: This will the main focus of this education session. 

Architecture patterns: These are also specific to your domain, but we will learn about simple architectures for non-distributed and distributed systems (In that oder) later on. 

Tools: we will learn about the most relevant tools, such as git, __, and __. However, this will be done with a strong emphasis on being able to teach yourself

*Also, if you think of something interesting that works, don’t be afraid to implement it. New students are often too scared of doing this because they think there is a “Correct” way to do things*

Interfaces: 
Do all the drawing out



Patterns: 
Regular Applications under our interface model:

Distributed applications under our interface model: 

1 client application. Can Demarshall responses and listen for requests, can connect to any number of additional interfaces
1 main applications: Can Marshall and send requests
