Programming is pretty simple: Know what you want, then make it. Google when you need to, and don't worry about something crazy.

Everyone will say something different about how to "Correctly Code". From this you can infer there isn't a correct way. So just write code, and if something actually becomes an issue, then fix it. 

In general:
* Be familiar with your language
* Be familiar with your environment aka the available Interfaces (These are your sources of true power)
    * OS Syscalls
    * IPC (File, Stdout, network, etc)
    * Hardware Devices
    * IO / UI's
    * Others code and services (Get using package manager, Network API's)
    * Applications/layers running on (Recursive)
* Know your dev tools (git, debugger, code editor, SDK, Command line)

Write a very basic solution, and then continuously improve upon it.
