# Ideas
* [Business presentations](https://github.com/TAMID-Tech-Consulting/education-resources/blob/master/slides/technical-presentations-in-business/Technical%20Presentations%20in%20Business.pdf)
* API, SDK, Libraries, Frameworks
* General Industry Tips
    * Presenting
    * If you need to reach out - let the person know what you have tried
    * Let people know directly when you have done a PR
    * CEO Rule: Don't come just with a problem, but also a solution so well though out all they have to say is yes. If you only tell them problems (no solution), they won't like you very much.
    * Make as many friends as possible
    * Assume you have to do it yourself
    * Sometimes just do things and ask for forgiveness later
    * Learn how to navigate politics
    * Stand up for yourself
* UI / UX
* Basic web dev

* Mention how managing risk and complexity play a large role in business application development
    * It tends to be that a lot of the code and work we do isn't actually the actual product, but things to manage the development of the project (Most things in devops) and managing (Testing) risk


To add
Interative development:
Most unlearn what you have leaned in Java

Business development:
1. Customer centric - you exist to solve a problem
2. Know how to empirically measure success (know your KPI’s and OBSESS over them)

Mention how important business is - I know some of you may look down on business majors - they are dumb, and that might be true, but business itself is the lifeblood of what you will be doing

Some notes on writing good code:
- beautiful code - readable
- I know you learned X in OOP, however, be wary of overabstracting, and of trying to design everything everything beforehand. This is not good for 2 reasons: 1. … 2. It’s not fun


# Misc
plan => code => test => deploy
build => measure => learn
UI
Program logic
State / Data

Other important aspects: 
* DevOps (This is a simplified version)
    * Deployment / Building
    * Monitoring
    * Testing 

Things to create: 
* Product (library, framework, drivers, language...)
* Service (website, )
Some are both: ex. Multiplayer video game, you must install the video game (product) and use their servers (service)
