    * If you need to reach out - let the person know what you have tried
    * Let people know directly when you have done a PR
    * CEO Rule: Don't come just with a problem, but also a solution so well though out all they have to say is yes. If you only tell them problems (no solution), they won't like you very much.
    * Make as many friends as possible
    * Assume you have to do it yourself
    * Sometimes just do things and ask for forgiveness later
    * Learn how to navigate politics
    * Stand up for yourself
* UI / UX
* Basic web dev

* Mention how managing risk and complexity play a large role in business application development
    * It tends to be that a lot of the code and work we do isn't actually the actual product, but things to manage the development of the project (Most things in devops) and managing (Testing) risk
