# Learning
The best way to learn to code is by coding
When something you don't understand comes up, search it up

In the beginning, resources such as youtube, ChatGPT, and random articles will be helpful. 
Once you reach more advanced material, or work at a company with in house tooling, these resources will lose their effectiveness

The best way to learn more advanced topics is by reading...
* code
* documentation
* whitepapers / research papers
* books

and by asking questions on...
* stackoverflow
* reddit
* github issues

## Code
You can often find source code for projects or libraries online. Just google for it or search on github  
[Malloc source](https://codebrowser.dev/glibc/glibc/malloc/malloc.c.html)  
[Linux OS source](https://github.com/torvalds/linux)

If the codebase is complex, use a debugger

## Documentation
Always find the documentation of the medium you are using  

bash / zsh: The command *man* (manual) gives the documentation. Since its a command, it also has documentation
```bash
man man
```

If you want to learn about the internet, RFC (request for comment) are specifications for how all the internet works.   
[IP Protocol](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc791)

## Whitepapers / Research Papers
Whitepapers are opinionated research papers.  
You can find research papers and whitepapers on google scholar
* [Internet Whitepaper](https://web.stanford.edu/class/msande91si/www-spr04/readings/week1/InternetWhitepaper.htm)
* [Resiliant Overlay Networks](https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/502034.502048?casa_token=6IdQD6H1RKkAAAAA:N6-bkSvra14Fiq0WGZDyL5JBdtMD0rqyc9NMW3dSVjMLZJmuO-13JXdOLxppFsbJUtRchHM4SijB)

## Books 
Books and Papers are amazing, use google scholar, library databases, or ask professors what they recommend 
* The art of computer programming, Donald Knuth
* TCP / IP Illustrated, Richard Stevens

# General Tips
* Learn [How to read](https://youtu.be/nqYmmZKY4sA?si=WmU-UNg3AoG5vD2e)
* Documentation >> Tutorials
* Don't get caught up in tutorial hell
* You don't need to know everything, so don't learn everything
* Learn at least 1 programming language truly in depth
* The goal is to code, so code
