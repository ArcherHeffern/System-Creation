# Business
Business is at the heart of software engineering  

Nobody wants to use software. They want to catch a Pokemon.

We write code to solve problems and provide VALUE to clients  
The client does not care if you use java or microservices or chatGPT  

Instead, be *obsessed* with what the customer needs  

Make decisions based on...
* The value it will provide
* The ease of executing
* The likelyhood of it working

This hits the fundementals of what you will see at a project level. There is a lot more complexity to it! Feel free to watch the rest although it is beyond the scope of what we cover

# Project Management Methodologies
How do we plan out and execute a project?

## Iterative Development part 2: Lean Ideologies
We talked about iterative development in Lecture 3.  

Lean is Project Management approach using iterative development. Specifically we apply a sort of scientific method appoach. We continuously self evaluate. If things work, keep going, if not, go back and try something new.

Build => Measure => Learn
 ^ This is where our existing framework lives

There are many ways to implement this: eg. Agile, Scrum, Kanban, XP, and many more

## Waterfall
Waterfall is an approach where you plan everything out in advance and then implement. There is no iteration.

## So which one do I choose?
Lean
* Voltile environments
    * Unsure exactly what your product is (eg. Startups)
    * Unsure what your users want (eg. Startups)
    * Unsure when you will next recieve funding
    * If you're generally unsure

Waterfall
* When you know what your product will be
* Projects with components that must be completed in a specific order
* Projects that must be correct first try (eg. Medical devices)

There seems to be a general transition to using Lean/Agile methodologies in the industry, but they both have their use cases

We will not delve into managing complexity at scale, as that is the next steps and only something you should consider when you run into that issue
