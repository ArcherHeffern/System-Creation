# Preface
I wrote this education for the purpose of helping students gain enough understanding and intuition of Software that they could do anything they wanted. 

> People think that computer science is the art of geniuses but the actual reality is the opposite, just many people doing things that build on each other, like a wall of mini stones.  - Donald Knuth

The development of software is also the same. No matter what you are going to be using someone else software, or hardware. So where do we start? Is there even a start? Well...not really, but its not hopeless. Instead, we will start with a specific revolutionary technology which almost everything in engineering builds off of, the Operating System. 

We are going to learn in depth the foundational API's. Starting from the OS level, harnessing its power in single process applications using System Calls, then multiprocess with IPC, build distributed applications with computer networking and learn about how many of the abstractions we take for granted work.

Core things when doing a project:
* Know the language
* Know the avaliable Interfaces
    * OS Syscalls
    * User Interfaces
    * IO
    * API's
    * Application running on (Recursive)
* Know your dev tools 
    * Managerial (git, debugger, code editor, notes app, Command line - TLDR: Helper applications that don’t themselves don’t spit out code)
        * Helper Applications and thing to install said applications
    * Code gen (Package manger (For programming language), libraries, SDK?)

* Being a good programmer
    * System Design
    * Good code
    * Debugging
    * Research capabilities
